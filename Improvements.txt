I could have improve this microservice further by:

--->  using graphql to customize queries for only required data, 
      hence to save bandwidth and maintain the overall application speed
      --> as i have noticed when making update request we only need some specific data

--->  running migrations to feed dummy data before testing

--->  running automated tests

--->  docker container for postgresDB

--->  eslinting, for uniform code guideline or pattern

--->  typescript for strict typechecking and to boost the development speed

--->  lastly, to build a notification service we need RabbitMQ or Kafka and trigger the notification
      when teachers tag students, we can maintain a Queue to keep track of the notification which are pending
      and store the notification history in DB or temporarily in Redis Cache.

IMPORTANT: I was not shortlisted but i am interested to work in Toddle,
           i was following toddle since last to get chance, If my submission meets your criteria 
           then i kindly request you to please allow me to appear for next round. Thank You
